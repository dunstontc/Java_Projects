I am a nutty guy who likes dolphins
I wonder what I and the world will be like in the year 2000
I hear silence pulsing in the middle of the night
I see a dolphin flying up to the sky
I want the adventure of life before it passes me by
I am a nutty guy who likes dolphins

I pretend that I'm the ruler of the world
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
I touch the sky the stars the moon and all the planets as
representatives of mankind
I worry about the devastation of a nuclear holocaust
I cry for all the death and poverty in the world
I am a nutty guy who likes dolphins

I understand the frustration of not being able to do something easily
I say that we are all equal
I dream of traveling to other points on the earth
I try to reach out to poor and starving children
I hope that mankind will be at peace and not die out
I am a nutty guy who likes dolphins
