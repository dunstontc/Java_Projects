            <p>
                Create a project named 'project5'.
                Create a CommissionReport class which is an application that
                will read data from a file named <b>project5.data</b>.
                The data in this file represents employee sales commission information for the 20
                sales-persons within a company. Each line is an employee number and commission amount.
                The application is to list those employees (and their commission value) whose commission
                amount is greater than the average for the entire group.
                The program should also report the average commission for the group.
            </p>

                Use sftp to retrieve the data file from cloud2.lp1241.us.
